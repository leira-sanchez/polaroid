It's been a couple of years since I left Capital One to join a Series A Y Combinator Startup as a Founding Frontend Engineer.

The truth is that working at a startup is risky. The earlier the stage, the riskier it is. At the time, I accepted the offer because it was the only company I interviewed with that let me work from Puerto Rico.

Not even 6 months later I was laid off. I got a puny severance and kept the MacBook. Equity was worth nothing.

⚡️After that, I worked at different startups, all early-stage. There are pros and cons to taking on this risk.

## 👍 What I like about working at startups

⭐️ Impact - At startups, every action has a direct effect. You're not just a cog in the machine; you're helping shape the product, culture, and direction. Your contributions are visible, and you can see the tangible results of your efforts in real-time.

⭐️ Learning - You get to wear many hats and be there from the start. This means diving into areas outside your expertise, which accelerates personal and professional growth.

⭐️ Potential upside - If the company does well and you have equity, that can turn into a significant financial windfall.

## 👎 The not so fun parts

❌ Stress - The pace is relentless. Resources are limited and there's always a fire to put out. The pressure to deliver and grow can be overwhelming.

❌ Financial risk - Startups are inherently volatile. Salaries might be below market rate (balanced by equity that may or may not turn into real money), benefits might be limited, and there's always the looming possibility of the company folding.
